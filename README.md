# What SLS Stand For
> Sign Up Login System
# What is the main idea of this
> I'm Trying To Make Sign Up And Login Systems as easy as possible to all developers for no time wasting 
# Disclaimer:
> Only SQLite works And Sign Up Only Works Right Now But In Future I Will Support All
# Usage:
> you will need to use unit function! by requiring the php file 
> now you will need The Table Name & Database File & The Database should equal to sqlite example code
> $UM = $_POST['Usernameinputnamehere'];
> $PW = $_POST['Passwordinputnamehere'];
> $EM = $_POST['Emailinputnamehere'];
> $DM = "sqlite";
> $DMF = "database.db";
> $TN = "the table name here";
> unit($UM, $PW, $EM, $DM, $DMF, $TN);
> // after that it should do it the trick with setting the cookie for user called UID
